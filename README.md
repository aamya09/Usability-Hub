<h1>Usability Hub- A Cloned Website</h1>
<p>UsabilityHub is a remote user research platform that takes the guesswork out of design decisions by validating them with real users.Integrated panel allows you to quickly and affordably recruit research participants that precisely match your target audience.

<h2>Tech Stack Used:-</h2>
<p>1- HTML</p>
<p><b>Test Creation: </b>When we create a test on UsabilityHub, we often need to provide content and structure for the test scenario. This include using HTML to structure text, images, buttons, and other elements that users will interact with during the test.
<b>Stimuli and Tasks:</b>In various types of tests, we used HTML to create the stimuli that users will be presented with, such as images, mockups, or website screenshots. HTML is also used to define the tasks or questions users need to respond to during the test.
<b>Response Collection:</b>For tests that involve user interaction, like click tests, we used HTML to create the elements users will interact with, such as buttons, links, or navigation menus. These elements were coded using HTML and linked to specific interactions users need to perform.
<b>Integration:</b>In some cases, we embedded UsabilityHub tests on our own website/platform, we felt the need to use HTML to integrate the test code into our site's pages.</p>
<p>2- CSS</p>
<p><b>Customization: </b>Depending on the features UsabilityHub offers, we were able to customize the appearance of the tests using HTML and CSS to match our branding and design preferences.</p>
